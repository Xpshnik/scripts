* _wiktionary_pluralize.py_ — a script scraping Wiktionary with the help of lxml module that prints and copies to clipboard plural form of nouns in any language;
* _Conway's_game_of_life.py_ — a classic cellular simulation script;
* _ipsweep.sh_ — an ip sweeper working for networks with masks of the type 255.255.255.0. It takes one argument — the network IP address prefix.
